I got interested in ternary logic and developed several circuits on MOS transistors and diodes, allowing to build ternary computing systems in the Webb and Rosser-Tewkett basis. 
Currently 10 circuits of elements are available.
F0, F1 and F2 files of characteristic function circuits.
Webb --- circuit file ternary Webb function.
AND, OR, NO --- circuit file ternary functions conjunction, disjunction, inversion.
CIKL_NOT --- circuit file ternary functions cyclic negation.
+MOD3 --- circuit file ternary functions addition modulo 3 without carry.
#MOD3 --- circuit file ternary functions multiplication modulo 3.
Circuits work in a balanced ternary number system.
